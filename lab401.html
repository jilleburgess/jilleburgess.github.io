<title>Birds are living dinosaurs!</title>

  <p>Did you know that birds are believed to be descendants of dinosaurs? This has been a highly debated topic among scientists, and dinosaurs were once believed to be giant lizards.
    But more recent discoveries have led scientists to believe that they have more bird-like tendencies.

  <h3>Birds of a feather...</h3>
  
  <p>The discovery of feathers on dinosaurs was a big turning point in the theory of the evolution of birds. A fossil containing a feather was first discovered in 1861 belonging to the bird-like dinosaur, Archaeopteryx. 
    Initially, a dinosaur's feathers served different functions before they evolved to be used for flight.
    Feathers were likely a means for warmth, and display for enemies or mates during courtship. Not all dinosaurs had feathers, and not all dinosaurs evolved to be birds; however, it is believed that all birds evolved from dinosaurs. </p>

  <h3>Make a wish</h3>

  <p>Another key factor which points to the relationship between birds and dinosaurs is a part of their skeletal structure - the wishbone! This bone is similar to a human's collarbones but the shape of the wishbone allows birds, and at one point, dinosaurs, to fly.</p>
