<h2>Birds are living dinosaurs!</h2>
  
  <p>Did you know that birds are believed to be descendants of dinosaurs? This has been a highly debated topic among scientists, and dinosaurs were once believed to be giant lizards.
    But more recent discoveries have revealed that they actually had some bird-like tendencies.
    </p>

  <h3>Birds of a feather...</h3>
  
  <p>The discovery of feathers on dinosaurs was a big turning point in the theory of the evolution of birds. A fossil containing a feather was first discovered in 1861 belonging to the bird-like dinosaur, Archaeopteryx. 
    Initially, a dinosaur's feathers served different functions before they evolved to be used for flight.
    Feathers were likely a means for warmth and display for enemies or mates during courtship. Not all dinosaurs had feathers, and not all dinosaurs evolved to be birds; however, this widely-believed theory explains that all birds evolved from dinosaurs. </p>

  <h3>Make a wish</h3>

  <p>Another key factor which points to the relationship between birds and dinosaurs is a part of their skeletal structure - the wishbone! This bone is similar to a human's collarbones but the shape of the wishbone allows birds, and at one point, dinosaurs, to fly. 
  Because this anatomical structure belongs to no other animal, it is a very convincing piece of evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Read more at <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/wishbones-and-dinosaurs">Audubon.org</a>.</p>

  <p>There are more aspects of the skeletal structure besides the wishbone that link dinosaurs to birds:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Hollow bones (for flight)</li>
    <li>Elongated arms and forelimbs</li>
    <li>Three-fingered hands, four-toed feet</li>
    <li>Large eye openings of the skull, called orbits</li>
  </ol>
